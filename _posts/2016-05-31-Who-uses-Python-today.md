Few daYS back started reading a python book named **Learning Python** by **Mark lutz** an **O'Reilly publication** and I decided to share my experience and thus will be writing a series of blogs on python based on the learning from this book.

There are more than a million python users around the world who uses python for scripting, general coding, application development, web development, testing, animation, scientific research and many more.

The major uses of python a general purpose object oriented programing language is as follows:
 * Google makes extensive use of python for web search engine systems
 * YouTube is largely written in python
 * Dropbox client software and server is in python
 * Raspberry Pi prefers python for its applications
 * EVE, a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) by CPP games uses python broadly
 * Bit Torrent a peer to peer file sharing system began as a python program
 * Industrial Light &amp; Magic , Pixar uses python for animation production
 * Google's App Engine web development framework uses python as an application language
 * The IronPort email server product uses more than 1 million lines of python code to do its job
 * Maya, a powerful integrated 3D modeling and animation system, provides a python scripting API
 * NSA uses python for cryptography and intelligence analysis
 * iRobot uses python to develop commercial and military robotic devices
 * Netflix and  Yelp have both documented the role of python in their software infrastructure
 * Intel, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Seagate, Qualcomm, and IBM uses python for hardware testing
 * JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Getco, and Citadel apply Python To financial market forcasting
 * NASA, Los Alamos, Fermilab, JPL and many others use scientific programming tasks
 * The Civilizations IV game's customizable scripted events are entirely in python
 * One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project built its user interface and activity model in python.

And the list goes on.......
